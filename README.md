<h1>Note-App-TS</h1>

<p>
I developed a Note-App using TypeScript features. You will be able to add hundreds of notes in this project. You will be able to filter the added notes according to their titles and tags. React-Dom and pagination structure were used in the project. By clicking on the note you will be directed to the editing page. You will be able to update the notes added here. You will be able to delete added notes.</p>
